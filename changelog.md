# Changelog

### Changes and updates over time.

|Version|Update classification|Update Note|
|:-----:|:-----:|:----------|
|July 13th, 2024|Major|Made every troll group vulnerable to this script by adding a mode prompt and adding a nuke mode that ignores any anti-keywording, which can bump the channel count higher.|
|May 16th, 2024|Major|Milestone 1 release: It terminates itself when it can't find any more channels, it asks for a rate, it gives more info about the channels being fetched, and it has an improved filter.|
|May 8th, 2024|Patch|Made it stop blocking the AUTTP and gave an actual tutorial. Also separated the changelog from the readme. (All of the MD stuff was recommended by my Dad's friend)|
|May 7th, 2024|Minor|Now saves the collected UTTP member name and ID lists to separate text files instead of needing to copy them directly from the terminal window.|
|May 6th, 2024|Major|First Version produced.|
